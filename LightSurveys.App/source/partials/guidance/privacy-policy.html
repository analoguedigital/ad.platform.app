        <h4 class="text-center">Of Tadpole Cottage Ltd, trading as analogue.DIGITAL</h4>
        <br />

        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Please read this document carefully to understand our approach to and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat any personal information you choose to provide to us</p>
        <p>Tadpole Cottage Ltd trading as analogue.DIGITAL (<strong>“we”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>), owns the OnRecord App (the <strong>“App”</strong>).  </p>
        <p>This privacy policy (the <strong>“Policy”</strong>) (together with our User Agreement) applies to your use of the App. </p>
        <p>By using the App you (the <strong>“User”</strong>) consent to your information being used in accordance with the Policy. Words and terms referred to in the Policy have the meanings ascribed to them in the User Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is Tadpole Cottage Ltd which is a company incorporated in England and Wales (registration number 7463715) with a registered office at Tadpole Cottage, Tadpole Lane, Blunsdon SN25 2DZ.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change the Policy by making an updated version of the App available for download. You are not obliged to download any updated App but in some circumstances you may not be able to continue using the App until you have downloaded the updated version.</p>

        <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
        <h4>Submitted Information</h4>
        <p>We may process information provided by you at the time of downloading, registering and using the App, securing or uploading Records via the App, providing feedback to us or requesting further services of us. We may also reply to, or ask you, for information if you contact us to report a problem with the App and we may process information submitted by you through other communications you send to us.</p>
        <p>In particular, we may collect and process information that you provide by filling in forms and answering questions arising from completing Records on the App, including your name and/or alias, and email address. Although when you create your account with us you will be required to provide personal information including your name, address and email address which we will use to validate your identity, for the purposes of creating the Records you do not have to use real names, for example for your children, as you may be reluctant to do so. For example you might choose to use letters as an identifier. Remember though that to make the records clear and unambiguous it is important to use the same means of identification for each person throughout and to keep a record in a safe place of who each person is and how they are identified. </p>
        <p>Once you have submitted Records they can no longer be edited or deleted by the User.  It is very important therefore that you only submit Records when they are accurate, clear and complete.  You can add further information or corrections at a later time by making a backdated Record, set at the same time and date as the original Record, to be read alongside the original. If something comes to mind afterwards (for example you may not have realised that an incident had been heard by a neighbour until you had spoken to them afterwards), you should add it as described above and if possible explain why you didn't include it before. </p>
        <p>User Records remain the property of the User.  Records will be retained by Us for as long as the User is receiving services provided by subscribing organisations or individuals (<strong>“Authorised Users”</strong>).  When the Authorised User has completed the work on behalf of the User, Records shall then be deleted securely, after no more than a month.  Where the User is not receiving services from an Authorised User, the User can choose to subscribe but if the User does not do so, uploaded Records will be deleted securely after a period of 1 month.  In both cases, prior to deletion the User will have the opportunity to download all saved Records.</p>

        <h4>Device Information</h4>
        <p>We may collect and process information about the mobile phone or other device you use to register for or access the App, including the device make, model, name, and product type. When you submit an image or video we also combine this information with location and validation information relevant to your mobile device (see below). Please note that we do not seek to collect identifiers relevant to user’s devices.</p>

        <h4>Location and other validation information</h4>
        <p>When you use the App, we will collect and process information about the location of your mobile device.  Such information is embedded and encrypted as part of the metadata in any image or video you record. This data is derived from a combination of: geolocation coordinates; nearby mobile cell tower IDs; WiFi networks or crowd sourced WiFi hotspots in range (where Wi-Fi is enabled); any bluetooth addresses that are in range (where bluetooth is enabled); and data derived from sensors in your device relating to your movement. This functionality is only enabled from the point at which you activate the camera, and is disabled after use. You can turn off this functionality at any time by switching off the location services settings on your mobile device. If you do turn this functionality off or if this functionality is not otherwise available, (e.g. your phone is out of range of WiFi), it will adversely affect the accuracy of the location of your mobile device and therefore may adversely impact the evidential value of your data.</p>
        <p>When you use the App, you also consent to us collecting, processing and using your device location data to provide and improve the location-based functionality on the App, and any enhancements to the App that we develop. This information is not combined with the IMSI of the device, and no user IP address is collected.</p>
        <p>We collect data which helps to validate and corroborate the authenticity or otherwise of Records you submit through the App. This data also provides you with a record of your use of the App. Please note, however, that you will not be able to access metadata regarding the Records you capture using the App via the App itself.  Unless you cancel the facility to do so, you will be able to view the data you have uploaded via the App and add to it but Records cannot be modified except after being exported by Authorised Users who you have permitted to have access to the data.  You will not be able to edit or delete information once it has been uploaded via the App unless you are permitted as an Authorised User.  Certain analytical and reporting functions of the App can also only be accessed by Authorised Users.</p>
        <p>You agree that we can store and use this data to help with validating and corroborating your content and to maintain the integrity of the App. With respect to any content that you choose to provide to an Authorised User, you agree that we can make the verification data available to that party.</p>

        <h4>Aggregated Data</h4>
        <p>In order to understand and better serve users of the App we compile aggregated statistics on the use of the App. This information does not identify users and we may share these statistics when describing the App and the service to other third parties.</p>

        <h3>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>We will use the information you provide to:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deliver you the services and information offered through the App and which you request;</li>
                <li>Audit the uploading and downloading of data via the App;</li>
                <li>Deliver the Authorised User the services and information offered through the web application and which they request. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>INFORMATION SHARING</h3>
        <p>If you upload Records via the App we may be required by law to disclose this content to relevant enforcement and other investigatory bodies and authorities.  Such disclosures may, as required by law, include all the content you make available, and may also include other information you have provided to us such as your name and location.</p>
        <p>In the event that your Records lead to criminal or civil proceedings, your information may be disclosed to legal professionals such as prosecutors and defence counsel as well as to the defendant(s) in such proceedings.  Such disclosure may include all the contents you make available, and may also include other information you have provided to us.</p>

        <h4>STORAGE AND SECURITY</h4>
        <p>All data that we collect from you is transferred to, and stored on servers at a destination within the European Economic Area. We use a service provider to support us in hosting our servers but they and their employees have no access to the content and/or information you upload via the App.</p>
        <p>In order to be able to maintain and, when necessary, repair our service, specifically identified employees of analogue.DIGITAL may need to access Users’ Records.  Any such access is strictly controlled and will be subject to stringent confidentiality controls by analogue.DIGITAL.</p>
        <p>Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to seek to control access to the information and to seek to reduce the risks of loss, misuse or unauthorised access to this information.</p>
        <p>The App employs a number of security features to seek to ensure it remains private and secure. Guidelines on these features are available on the Website and in the App User Agreement.  It is important that you fully understand and use these features in order to prevent unauthorised access to your account and to help protect the content you generate and importantly your security and safety as a user. </p>

        <h4>YOUR RIGHTS</h4>
        <p>You have a legal right under the Data Protection Act 1998 to a copy of any personal information about you held by us. On request, we will provide you with a copy of this information, subject to a fee not exceeding the permitted statutory maximum. You also have a right to correct any errors in that information.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to decline requests that are unreasonably repetitive or that jeopardise the privacy of others, the validation facility, or the interests of justice or where we are otherwise permitted by law.</p>
        <p>More information on data privacy rights is available directly from the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>

        <h4>CHILD SAFETY</h4>
        <p>The safety of children when using online services is very important to us. We recommend that children receive permission from those holding parental responsibility for them before gaining access to the App or sending personal information to us or anyone else online.</p>
        <p>We hope, though, that the app will be a useful resource to children experiencing any form of bullying, discrimination or abuse when they believe they are not being listened to and need to produce some evidence to access help. </p>

        <h4>CONTACTING US</h4>
        <p>Please submit any questions, concerns or comments you have about this privacy policy or any requests concerning your personal data by email to <a href="mailto:info@analogue.digital">info@analogue.digital</a>. </p>
