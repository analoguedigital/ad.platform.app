        <h3>OnRecord App User Agreement</h3>

        <p>This is a legal agreement between you (the <strong>“User”</strong>) and Tadpole Cottage Ltd, trading as analogue.DIGITAL (<strong>“analogue.DIGITAL"</strong>), a company incorporated in England and Wales (registration number 7463715) with its registered office at Tadpole Cottage, Tadpole Lane, Blunsdon SN25 2DZ.</p>
        <p>By downloading, accessing and/or using the OnRecord App (the <strong>“App”</strong>) owned by analogue.DIGITAL, the User confirms that he/she accepts and agrees to be bound by these terms and acknowledges that they constitute a legally binding contract between analogue.DIGITAL and the User.  If the User does not agree to all of these terms, the User is not permitted to access or use the App, should not click to accept these terms and should not proceed further.</p>

        <h3>Purpose of the App</h3>
        <p>The primary purpose of the App is to record notes, photos, videos, audio recordings and/or documents on a timeline (the <strong>“Records”</strong>) which can, with the User's permission, be shared with subscribing organisations or individuals (<strong>“Authorised Users”</strong>) who access our platform (<strong>"the Platform"</strong>) in accordance with General Conditions of Use included in our legally binding contract with an Authorised User.  Authorised Users are, typically, charity workers, social workers, police officers, lawyers and other advisors who will access the Records which can be searched, sorted and managed to use as evidence, if relevant, in any legal proceedings or any other action contemplated by an Authorised User.  Authorised User also includes any other individual or organisation analogue.DIGITAL permits as an Authorised User. In the event the User does not give permission to an Authorised User and chooses not to subscribe as an individual, the User can access his/her records on the mobile device but without access to the more advanced reporting, analysis and downloading facilities available to Authorised Users.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: The User should always be aware of the risks involved in collecting Records which might be used as evidence in legal proceedings  (e.g. where they relate to circumstances where the user is being subjected to domestic abuse ) and should exercise extreme caution at all times and take all available precautions, including abandoning collection, deleting records on the App or deleting the App itself, if necessary.  Deletion of the App will not delete any Records that have previously been uploaded.  THE USER SHOULD NEVER PUT HIM/HERSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE USING OR POSSESSING THE APP MAY PLACE HIM/HER OR ANYONE ELSE, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, AT RISK OF HARM. </p>
        <p>The App has features to help protect the User and the Records collected but analogue.Digital cannot guarantee the safety of the User or any other individual who is referred to in the Records. The App icon can be disguised (future Android version only), access can be controlled by password, PIN and fingerprint and records on the mobile device can be deleted.  However, if Records have not been deleted they may be accessed if the User’s mobile device is seized and pressure is put on the User to open the App. Users should familiarise themselves with all these security features of the App before using it.</p>

        <h3>Use of the App</h3>
        <p>The User may only use the App for lawful purposes, and must not use the App to engage in or facilitate any illegal activity.  </p>
        <p>The User must comply with all laws and regulations, including those relating to capture, use and sharing of Records, applicable in the location when he/she uses the App.</p>
        <p>The User may use the App only for non-commercial purposes and only in accordance with this agreement (and in accordance with any applicable terms of any relevant third party service provider e.g. a mobile service provider for the device to which the User downloads, or on which it accesses or uses the App.)</p>
        <p>The User is assumed to have obtained permission from the owner of any device that is controlled but not owned by the User to download the App to that device. The User accepts responsibility, in accordance with this agreement, for all access to and use of the App by the User on any device, whether or not it is owned by the User.</p>
        <p>The User acknowledges that the mobile service provider for the device to which the User downloads, or on which the User accesses or uses the App may charge for internet access (including mobile data usage) on that device.</p>
        <p>analogue.DIGITAL retains the right to block submissions from Users who use the App to capture Records outside the purpose of the App or who attempt to use the App to engage in or facilitate any illegal activity.  </p>
        <p>analogue.DIGITAL does not guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or error-free operability of the App.</p>
        <p>analogue.DIGITAL reserves the right to change the design, features and/or functionality of the App by making the updated App available for download.
