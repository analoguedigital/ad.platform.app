        <h3>Add a new thread</h3>
        <p>To start making records, click on ‘Add a new thread’. Choose a name and colour for the thread that will allow you to remember what your records will be about. See our guidance for advice about the naming of threads in different situations. You can add as many threads as you want, to keep track of different types of event and different issues.  Each thread will be colour coded so that you can tell them apart on the timeline.  You can change the name or colour of a thread if you need to.</p>

        <h3>When did it happen?</h3>
        <p>The default setting is the current date and time. To make an accurate record, enter the actual date and time of the event so that it will be recorded on the timeline and in the calendar to show when it happened. You can backdate entries.</p>

        <h3>What happened?</h3>
        <p>Remember that the more detail and facts you put here the better your record will be.</p>
        <p>In telling the story, try to answer each question:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who?</li>
                <li>What?</li>
                <li>Where?</li>
                <li>Why?</li>
                <li>With what result?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>If there were witnesses, give their names and contact details here.</p>
        <p>If there were children present, and it could have been harmful to them, say so here and say which children.</p>
        <p>Say how the event has affected you. Has it stopped you from doing something or made you do something you would not otherwise have done? If the event has upset you or had a severe impact on you or someone else, explain what.</p>

        <h3>Rate the impact of this event on you</h3>
        <p>This is important for the records. Impact means how much the event has affected you or someone else.  You can move the slider from 1 to 3, the higher the number the greater the impact.  If it’s affected someone else, say who was affected and how they were affected in the ‘What happened’ section. It may have upset you or the other person or it may have caused fear or made you or someone else change what they were doing or going to do.</p>

        <h3>Upload pictures, audio etc.</h3>
        <p>For safety’s sake, take a photo or a video through the app, rather than using the phone’s own camera. Taking photos etc through the app means that the record is not stored on your phone but only on our secure server.</p>
        <p>Photos and videos will be tagged for place and time.</p>

        <h3>Submit</h3>
        <p>Saves the encrypted record to our secure server. Your original record cannot be changed once it’s saved but if you need to change something, just make a new record with the changes but date it to the same date and time as the original so that the two records can be seen together.</p>
